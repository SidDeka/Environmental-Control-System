# Environmental-Control-System
System that reads temperature, humidity, and pressure using the BME280 sensor and light intensity using the TSL2561 sensor. The system can operate in three modes: automatic, manual, and gesture control. In automatic mode, it adjusts the cooling and lighting levels based on temperature and light intensity. In manual mode, the user can increase or decrease the levels using buttons. In gesture control mode, the system uses the MPU6050 accelerometer to detect gestures for adjusting the levels. The system includes a single display interface for reporting sensor readings
